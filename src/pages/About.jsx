        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate software developer with expertise in Python, Java, React, HTML/CSS/Javascript, and Prolog. In addition, I have experience
        in Go, Assembly, PHP, Lisp, and R.</p>
        <p>I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a BA in Computer Science in the Spring of 2024. After this, I attended a Software Development Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota to gain more project experience. With all of the new skills I have learned over the past years, I hope to get my first software development job where I can put them to use. For more of my professional experience, please refer to my resume.</p>

        <p>When I am not coding, I enjoy gaming, gardening, painting, photography, diamond art, kpop/krock, cleaning, going to art fairs, trying new food, and taking care of my two cats. I am a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls games, the Lord of the Rings, the Simpsons, and classic Disney movies. </p>
