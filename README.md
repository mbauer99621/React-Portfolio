# Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website showcasing my projects. It includes various web applications I've developed.

## Features
- Displays a list of projects with descriptions and images
- Uses React for component-based development

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Component-based UI development
- **CSS**: Styling and layout
- **JavaScript **: Logic and interactivity

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bauermm9/React-Portfolio.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd <to the folder it downloaded as>
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## How It Works
Use the navigation bar to check out the different sections of the website.

## Future Improvements
- Correct the image layout

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
